# Running MRO Experiments
For each set of experiments, change the destination foldernames and run the corresponding files:

| Experiment name     | Python file |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Continuous portfolio     |portcont.py      |
| Sparse portfolio   | portMIP.py      |
| Facility location  |facility.py        |
| Continuous newsvendor   | newscont.py      |
| Sparse newsvendor   | newsMIP.py       |
| Quadratic concave   | quadratic.py       |
| Log-sum-exp concave   | logsumexp.py      |

Upon obtaining the dataframe, run the coresponding plots.py file to obtain desired plots.
